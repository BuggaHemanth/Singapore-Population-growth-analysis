# Singapore-Population-growth-analysis
This project's focus is to analyse the growth of population of Singapore over decades. Teh data belongs to the period between 1957 and 2018. Analysis has been done with respect to the age, ethnicity and gender. It is found that there is a sharp decline in the population during 1970 and 1980. Ethnic groups of Malay, Chinese and Indians showed a stable population growth while 'other' ethnic group's population was fluctuating. The reason for this fluctuation might be due to the change in Singapore government policies which influence inflow of immigrants. On an average there is no much variation in population growth with respect to the gender.
